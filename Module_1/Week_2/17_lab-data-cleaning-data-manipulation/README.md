# Lab | Data Cleaning and Data Manipulation

## Introduction

You have probably heard this before, but data scientists spend the majority of their time processing and preparing data. In this lesson, we will get our feet wet with this process.

## Getting Started

Open the `main.ipynb` file in the `your-code` directory. Follow the instructions and add your code and explanations as necessary. By the end of this lab, you will have learned how to clean and munge a merged dataset.

## Deliverables

- `main.ipynb` with your responses.

## Submission

Upon completion, add your deliverables to git. Then commit git and push your branch to the remote.
